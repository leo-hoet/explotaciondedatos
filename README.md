# Data explotarion techonologies

Jupyter notebooks used in data explotation technologies assignature from [UTN FRCU](http://www.frcu.utn.edu.ar/)


## TP1: Supervised trainig
Using a patient dataset, we can predict if a patient has a heart disease using a decision tree, na√Øve bayes or neural network.

## TP2: Unsupervised training

Used unsupervied trainnig, Kmeans and DBSCAN in examples dataset to find clusters and other associations

## TP3: Outlier detection

With statistical methods and data minning methods, we found outliers in a wine dataset.

## TP FINAL: Soccer player score prediction

Using a public available Soccer player data, we could predict the rating of each player and found some cluster inside the dataset.
